### Goal
*****

Experimental and computational studies of neural structures and activity abound but many consider neural systems in fully formed networks. This project aims to understand how spatial dimension constrains how neural networks are formed and how those networks shape corresponding neural activity (i.e. "spikes"). This may give rise to a better understanding of how networks form in vivo and in vitro and how that translates to cognition.

&nbsp;
### Justification
******

Neuronal networks are complex, dynamical systems whose behavior emerges from interactions between individual neurons. Neuron shape and function come in different varieties with heterogeneities in the type and number of synaptic connections that form networks. Using agent-based modeling to simulate individual neurons and their connections will allow me to examine how these heterogeneities affect the growth and maintenence of networks and how those networks consequently shape neuronal activity.

&nbsp;
### Main Micro-level Processes and Macro-level Dynamics of Interest
*****

As I will outline below, I want to examine how different spatial dimensions affect the network structure and subsequent activity of those networks. The micro-level processes I will focus on are the rules for synapse formation and the activity of individual neurons. Synapses will form probabilistically by surveying their local environment for (possibly noisy) activity. The activity itself will follow a simple integrate-and-fire formalism, where persistent, environment-driven input will drive early activity and emergent synaptic input will come into effect as networks form. These networks will be probed for structure and other network features including clustering, centrality, and connectivity distribution. Further, by modifying the integrate-and-fire rules to allow for different excitability types, I will examine emergent behavior of network activity by analyzing spiking dynamics for phase coherence/synchronization and effective network connectivity, i.e. networks calculated based on activity instead of structure.
